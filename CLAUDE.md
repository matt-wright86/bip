# Build in Public (BiP) Project

## Overview
Build in Public is a weekly lightly moderated open forum at Improving (a consulting company). The purpose is to create space for narrating real work, sharing unfinished thinking, and learning through explanation rather than performance.

**Facilitator**: Matthew Wright
**Schedule**: Thursdays at 1:30 PM (was originally Fridays)
**Format**: ~1 hour hybrid meeting (in-office + remote participants)

## File Naming Convention
All files should use the format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-<descriptor>.md
```
Examples:
- `2026-01-30-session-summary.md`
- `2026-01-30-run-sheet.md`

Session folders are named by date: `M-DD-YY` (e.g., `1-30-26`)

## Session Workflow

### Before the Meeting
1. Review last week's transcript and summary
2. Create a **run sheet** with:
   - Recording consent reminder
   - Welcome preamble
   - Board link (agile.coffee)
   - Recap of previous session
   - Voting instructions
   - Outro template

### During the Meeting
- Drop board link in chat: `http://agile.coffee/#<board-id>`
- Participants get 6 votes to distribute across discussion items
- Facilitate top-voted items
- Use guardrails if discussion drifts to abstraction:
  - "Can you give a specific example?"
  - "What did that look like in practice?"
  - "What signal did you miss in hindsight?"

### After the Meeting
1. Save transcript (VTT file from Teams)
2. Screenshot the board state
3. Create **session summary** capturing:
   - Topics discussed with key points
   - Participant contributions
   - Insights and themes
   - Follow-up items

## Key Documents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `build-in-public.md` | Core context document - spirit, intent, operating principles |
| `historical-convo.md` | ChatGPT conversation history showing BiP evolution |
| `YYYY-MM-DD-run-sheet.md` | Facilitator's guide for a specific session |
| `YYYY-MM-DD-session-summary.md` | Post-meeting synthesis |

## BiP Philosophy

### What BiP Is
- Open, collaborative, voluntary
- Grounded in lived experience ("I tried...", "I noticed...", "I realized...")
- Low-pressure, high-trust
- An on-ramp to thought leadership, not a gate

### What BiP Is Not
- Polished demos or debates
- A place to arrive at consensus
- A backlog or voting mechanism for truth

### Board Item Qualities
Good board items are:
- Experiential, not abstract
- Imply a story already happened
- Reflect unfinished thinking
- Grounded in real work

Items move to "Done Discussing" when insight has been harvested—not because the topic is resolved.

## Session Shape

### Intro
- Welcome, restate intent
- Remind of "law of two feet" (leave when you need to)
- Everyone declares a goal (curiosity counts)

### Middle
- 1-2 discussion items based on votes
- Emphasis on narration, not expertise

### Outro
- Reconnect discussion to BiP intent
- Acknowledge contributors
- Invite participants back

## Welcome Preamble
> "Welcome to Build in Public, or BiP.
>
> This is an open space for building—blog posts, workflows, hobby projects, or anything still forming. The point isn't polish, it's progress.
>
> We're here to share, encourage one another, and offer accountability. We all lift together. Come when you can, be an Improver, and build with us.
>
> Remember the law of two feet—bounce when you need to.
>
> Everyone comes to BiP with a goal. That goal might be curiosity, but everyone has one. Let's start by sharing our goals for this session."
