# Build in Public (BiP)

## Purpose of This Document

This document exists to preserve **full conversational context** for Build in Public as it transitions into an IDE-based workflow. It is intended to:

- Capture the _spirit, intent, and operating principles_ of BiP
- Summarize recent discussions and learnings
- Provide guidance for shaping board items and facilitation
- Anchor an upcoming discussion topic on validating ideas before sharing publicly

This is not a formal process doc. It is a **working memory artifact**.

## What Build in Public Is

Build in Public (BiP) is a **lightly moderated open forum** designed to create space for:

- Narrating real work
- Sharing unfinished thinking
- Exploring ideas in motion
- Learning through explanation, not performance

BiP is intentionally _not_ about polished demos, debates, or arriving at consensus. Its value comes from **making thinking visible** and allowing others to reason alongside it.

### Core Characteristics

- Open, collaborative, and voluntary
- Grounded in lived experience ("I tried…", "I noticed…", "I realized…")
- Low-pressure, high-trust
- Focused on learning and articulation rather than resolution

BiP functions as an **on-ramp to thought leadership**, not a gate.

## Standard Session Shape (Loose, Not Prescriptive)

### Intro

- Welcome to Build in Public
- Restate intent and rules of engagement
- Remind participants of the _law of two feet_
- Invite everyone to declare a goal for the session (curiosity counts)

### Middle

- One primary discussion item (sometimes two)
- Open discussion, lightly moderated
- Emphasis on narration, not expertise

### Outro

- Reconnect discussion to BiP intent
- Acknowledge contributors
- Invite participants back
- Encourage bringing goals and works-in-progress to the next session

## Key Learnings from Recent Sessions (Synthesis)

### 1. Narration Accelerates Insight

Explaining work out loud—whether through journaling, AI reflection, or peer discussion—reveals gaps, assumptions, and opportunities faster than working alone.

Narration benefits:

- Personal clarity
- Better system design
- Improved stakeholder communication

### 2. AI Resistance Is Often Emotional, Not Technical

Resistance to AI has shifted from questions of capability to concerns about:

- Job security
- Identity and personal values
- Environmental and societal impact

These concerns are real and often unintentionally dismissed in public forums.

### 3. Public vs. Private Conversations Need Different Tones

- Private conversations build trust and allow fear to be met with empathy
- Public conversations help surface patterns and shared understanding
- Both are necessary; neither alone is sufficient

### 4. Engineers Often Default to Solving Instead of Listening

Many engineers lack tools or comfort for emotional or relational conversations. This can unintentionally silence non-technical voices or those still forming their understanding.

### 5. Supporting Non-Technical Roles Requires Translation, Not Internals

Non-technical improvers benefit most from AI when discussions start with:

- Business goals
- ROI
- Stakeholder needs

Explaining how "the sausage is made" is often less helpful than explaining how it helps someone do their job.

### 6. Quieter Voices Carry Untapped Value

A small number of recurring voices often dominate discussion. BiP works best when:

- Facilitators notice who is not speaking
- Space is gently made for quieter contributors
- Dominance (including facilitator dominance) is interrupted when needed

### 7. Build in Public Has Boundaries

Not all topics belong in BiP. Some conversations—especially those centered on deep fear or people management—may need to move elsewhere.

BiP can still:

- Surface signals
- Name tensions
- Encourage better listening

## Board Philosophy

The BiP board is not a backlog or a voting mechanism for truth.

An effective board item is:

> A snapshot of thinking-in-motion that could help someone else reason better.

### Board Items Should:

- Be experiential, not abstract
- Imply a story already happened
- Reflect unfinished thinking
- Be grounded in real work

### Examples of Strong Board Items

- "Neat observation related to daily journaling and personal growth"
- "How I built logging systems for AI development"
- "Creating talks from unfinished thinking"

### Items Are Moved to "Done Discussing" When:

- The group has harvested insight
- Not because the topic is resolved

Think of this column as **Harvested**, not finished.

---

## Suggested Board Prompt Patterns (Not Read Aloud)

- Something I tried that didn’t work the way I expected
- A realization I only had after explaining it to someone else
- A tool that worked technically but failed socially
- A problem that got clearer once I narrated it
- A talk, blog, or idea I’m shaping—not finished

These prompts subtly guide the board without enforcing rules.

## Current Discussion Topic Context

### Working Title

**How I decide when an idea is “ready” to share publicly**

### Why This Topic Fits BiP

- It is experiential, not prescriptive
- It surfaces vulnerability without forcing it
- It naturally invites stories rather than advice
- It aligns with narration, confidence, and iteration

### Framing Notes

This topic should be introduced as something actively being wrestled with—not as a request for best practices.

The goal is to explore:

- Signals people look for before sharing
- Times people shared too early or waited too long
- How audience, context, and fear influence decisions

Avoid turning the discussion into:

- A checklist
- A publishing playbook
- A debate about confidence vs. perfectionism

---

## Facilitation Guardrails (Invisible)

If discussion drifts toward abstraction, gently steer with:

- "Can you think of a time you shared something too early—or too late?"
- "What signal did you miss in hindsight?"
- "Who were you really sharing it for?"

These questions pull conversation back to lived experience.

## Closing Thought

Build in Public works when it remains:

- Human
- Incomplete
- Generous

This document is not meant to freeze the practice—only to **carry its memory forward** as tools and contexts change.
