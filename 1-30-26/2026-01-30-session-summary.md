## Topics Discussed

### 1. How Can We Make Better Use of Our In-Office Time (10 votes)
**Raised by**: Alexander Reeves

Alexander opened by noting that the main reason people enjoy coming to the office is to socialize and interact with colleagues—not just formal presentations. He asked the group to consider creating more deliberate, coordinated time for interaction.

Matthew facilitated by going around the room asking: **"What is the biggest value you get out of coming into the office?"**

**Responses:**

- **Terrence**: The value is intrinsic, not explicit. It's about symbiotic relationships—learning from colleagues while also teaching. The push vs. pull dynamic from marketing applies: you want to pull people in through engagement, not just push requirements.

- **Alexis**: Getting natural breaks. At home he'd grind without stopping, but in the office, bumping into people forces healthy mental breaks and leads to helpful problem-solving conversations (shared an example with Daniel).

- **Daniel**: Went straight to the answer—**be intentional**. "Spontaneous means interrupting someone. If you came to the office expecting to get heads-down work done, you made the wrong choice. This is not where you go for heads-down work." Plan to be interrupted. Plan to interrupt. Example: BiP was set on Fridays originally to catch people coming for the Learning Circle.

- **Jonathan**: For him, office interruptions are actually less disruptive than working from home with young kids. He's always learning something from the smart people here. "It's that camaraderie that pulls me in."

- **Claudio**: Takes a holistic view—the entire commute is part of the in-office experience. Uses drive time for voice journaling and prep. Plans pomodoros, takes breaks during them to play pool or socialize, then captures ideas from conversations. The commute home serves as a decompression transition.

- **Josh Fryer (remote)**: For him, office visits are about building intentional relationships. "Trust is built in the moments, but it's proven in crises." People won't come to you in a crisis if they don't trust you, and in-person time builds that trust more effectively.

- **Matthew**: Enjoys being around people he can learn from. In the past 2-3 months of intentionally being in the office, he started public speaking, joined BiP, and started a blog—things that wouldn't have happened sitting at home alone.

**Key Insight**: Everyone had a genuine reason for valuing office time—nobody said "I'm only here because I have to be." The answer to making better use of in-office time: **intentionality**.

### 2. Talk About How to Use AI in a Non-Technical Skill Set but Still Have a Technical Lead (7 votes)
**Raised by**: Terrence

Terrence reflected on an internal "Air Talk" where a non-developer (a PM) asked about leveraging AI and got unhelpful, developer-focused answers that didn't make sense from a PM standpoint.

His idea: As someone who does both development and non-technical AI work (like marketing), he wants to create a talk that helps non-technical people use AI effectively—but realizes he can't explain 4 years of marketing knowledge AND 20 years of programming in 10 minutes.

**Discussion:**

- **Claudio**: Suggested splitting the audience—two separate talks for technical and non-technical audiences. "More is better."

- **Terrence**: What if he partnered with someone with an MBA to do a joint talk? They cover the non-technical side, he covers the developer perspective.

- **Daniel**: "The best way to solve this is to change the problem." The challenge Terrence faces is real, but task decomposition is key—get it down to smaller, simpler tasks.

- **Devlin**: Reinforced why they structured training as separate tracks (Product Owner, QA, Dev)—different nomenclatures and backgrounds require meeting people at their vocabulary for adoption to happen.

- **Claudio**: Shared his approach—voice journal all ideas first without worrying about audience, then use AI to tailor the same content to different audiences. "Same source, different lenses."

- **Daniel**: Offered a framework—three questions for any communication: (1) What do you want them to do at the end? (2) What do they need to know to do that? (3) What feeling connects the knowledge to the action?

- **Alexander Reeves**: Admitted he struggles with this—he's so deep in AI that he doesn't know how to bring someone from zero. "Curse of knowledge."

**Terrence's Takeaway**: "I'm in the same place, but I'm more cognizant that I'm at the starting line."

### 3. How Does Your Project Relate to Your Values or Vision for Yourself? (6 votes)
**Raised by**: Daniel

Daniel posed this as a philosophical question: With AI compressing time, are you still spending it potently? Everyone makes choices about what to pursue—hobbies, interests, goals. The "heck yes or no" litmus test.

**Daniel's Example**: Leatherworking. He enjoyed it, made wallets, but realized he doesn't have the time to dedicate to it. Now he has a box of tools under his desk that he keeps kicking, forcing the question: "Is this still something I want to do?" The answer finally landed on "no"—now he's looking for a good home for the tools.

**Devlin's Pushback**: Challenged the assumption that you should jettison things that don't align. Keeping tools stored doesn't hurt—constraints change. Maybe you'll teach your kids someday. "Your job is not to make the commitment permanent if circumstances might change."

**Discussion evolved into:**

- **Have vs. Do vs. Be**: Claudio shared the framework—do you want to *have* a published book? *Be* an author? Or just *do* the writing? Understanding which of these applies to your project helps clarify what you're actually pursuing.

- **Achievement vs. Accolade**: Devlin distinguished between intrinsic motivation (doing for the thing itself) and extrinsic motivation (doing for recognition). Olympians won't do absurd training without the medal. But someone like Don McGreal spends 30 hours prepping a class he's done 1200 times because he cares about the people in the room.

- **Wasting Time Intentionally**: Jonathan raised the idea that sometimes "wasting" time on something is the value. There's a difference between being efficient with people (feels bad) vs. investing time in them generously.

- **Terrence**: Introduced the Caribbean concept of "liming"—going out with the intention of just spending time, lollygagging, being yourself in public.

- **Marketing Can Be Genuine**: Jonathan closed with the distinction between marketing as manipulation (leading to cynicism) vs. marketing in service of a truth you want to help people see. "Marketing can be genuine and true. It doesn't have to be a false facade."

## Key Themes & Insights

1. **Intentionality is the throughline**—whether discussing office time, AI teaching, or personal projects, the group kept returning to being deliberate about choices.

2. **Task decomposition** applies beyond code—Terrence's talk challenge and the AI teaching discussion both came back to breaking big things into smaller, more manageable pieces.

3. **Know your audience**—whether presenting, teaching, or marketing, meet people where they are with their vocabulary and context.

4. **The value of interruption**—the office isn't for heads-down work; it's for the serendipitous learning and relationship-building that happens when you're interruptible.

5. **Have / Do / Be framework**—useful for clarifying what you actually want from a project (publishing a book vs. being an author vs. writing).

6. **Achievement vs. Accolade**—understanding whether you're intrinsically or extrinsically motivated helps you invest time wisely.
