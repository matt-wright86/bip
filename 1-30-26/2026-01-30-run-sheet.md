## 2. Welcome & Preamble

> "Welcome to Build in Public, or BiP.
>
> This is an open space for building—blog posts, workflows, hobby projects, or anything still forming. The point isn't polish, it's progress.
>
> We're here to share, encourage one another, and offer accountability. We all lift together. Come when you can, be an Improver, and build with us.
>
> Remember the law of two feet—bounce when you need to.
>
> Everyone comes to BiP with a goal. That goal might be curiosity, but everyone has one. Let's start by sharing our goals for this session."

## 4. Recap Last Week (1-23-26)

> "Quick recap from last week.
>
> We discussed knowing when an idea is ready to share publicly. Daniel pushed past my framing about cadence to the real issue: fear of judgment hiding behind 'the idea isn't ready.'
>
> He had me do an exercise live—texting five people to describe me in three words. The insight: you never know when something is ready. You simply choose.
>
> We also covered AI-assisted writing workflows and client resistance to recording meetings—Josh introduced the framing of brave space versus safe space.
>
> That's where we left off."

## 6. Discussion

- Facilitate the top-voted item(s)
- Use guardrails if needed:
  - "Can you give a specific example?"
  - "What did that look like in practice?"
  - "What signal did you miss in hindsight?"
