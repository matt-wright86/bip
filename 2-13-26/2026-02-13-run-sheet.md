## 2. Welcome & Preamble

> "Welcome to Build in Public, or BiP.
>
> This is an open space for building—blog posts, workflows, hobby projects, or anything still forming. The point isn't polish, it's progress.
>
> We're here to share, encourage one another, and offer accountability. We all lift together. Come when you can, be an Improver, and build with us.
>
> Remember the law of two feet—bounce when you need to.
>
> Everyone comes to BiP with a goal. That goal might be curiosity, but everyone has one. Let's start by sharing our goals for this session."

## 4. Recap Last Week (2-06-26)

> "Quick recap from last week.
>
> Josh Fryer kicked us off by asking how the group **makes space for writing and content creation**. We went around the room and got a range of approaches—Terrence writes during quiet windows and uses BiP as social accountability, Claudio voice journals during his commute and never faces a blank page thanks to Obsidian notes, Jonathan carries a dedicated recorder (and recently shifted to a phone widget), and Joanna shared the real friction of voice recording and AI conversation mode interrupting your thoughts. The consensus: capture first, process later—and don't overthink the tools.
>
> Claudio shared his **TLC Q2 speaker search**—Q1 is fully booked and he's lining up presenters for April and beyond. Josh got introduced to The Learning Circle and may practice a talk there.
>
> Claudio also walked us through **migrating his blogging workflow from ChatGPT to Windsurf**—markdown-based rules, auto taxonomy tagging, and WordPress uploads. He's been posting daily as an experiment. Joanna highlighted the unreliability of ChatGPT's memory feature, which reinforced why the move makes sense.
>
> Josh closed with a great story about **getting feedback after a conference rejection**. He asked for reviewer feedback and got eight detailed points within three hours. The reviewers independently agreed his talk would work better as a lightning talk. Claudio offered him a TLC slot to practice.
>
> That's where we left off."
