> "Welcome to Build in Public, or BiP.
>
> This is an open space for building—blog posts, workflows, hobby projects, or anything still forming. The point isn't polish, it's progress.
>
> We're here to share, encourage one another, and offer accountability. We all lift together. Come when you can, be an Improver, and build with us.
>
> Remember the law of two feet—bounce when you need to.
>

## 4. Recap Last Week (2-13-26)

> "Quick recap from last week. I wasn't here — Daniel facilitated in my absence, so thanks to him for stepping in.
>
> Daniel kicked things off with a project he's been working on: building a **library of prompts and workflows for non-developers**. He walked through two examples — a research workflow that compresses the find-read-summarize cycle using AI, and a Wardley Map facilitation guide built with Jonathan's expertise. The big idea: AI is a tool maker's tool, and reorganizing the steps of a workflow — not just automating them — is what unlocks AI-compressible work. Claudio pushed back constructively, arguing you need to understand the friction before building the tooling. That turned into a good exchange about wants vs. needs — Claudio shared a story about using AI to understand stakeholder explanations he wasn't fully grasping, then presenting the AI-assisted understanding back to them.
>
> Claudio then presented his **three-part AI Development Series for ImprovingU** — Part 1 turns spreadsheets into apps, Part 2 has groups working with product owners to prototype solutions, and Part 3 is sprint review practice. He demoed his TLC scheduling app, which he built from Ahmed's old spreadsheet in about 10 minutes. Terrence connected it to his idea about bridging the gap for non-developers and mentioned Jeannie and Mike would be interested. Claudio's targeting March for the launch and needs assistants — he's counting on Alexis and me.
>
> Joanna did a **temperature check on event sourcing** for her upcoming TLC talk. Responses ranged from 'never heard of it' to Jonathan's war story about a retail company that recovered from a total failure because they'd implemented event sourcing throughout their infrastructure. Daniel pushed the 'shiny hammer' question — when is it overkill? — and Joanna shared that she's in the middle of a 20,000-line PR converting a client to event sourcing with a dual-write migration.
>
> The session closed with a brief discussion about **creating a TLC topic proposal process** — Claudio pointed to the existing Teams channel as the right place, no new tooling needed.
>
> That's where we left off."

## 5. Check the Board / Vote

> "Let's see what's on the board. You have 6 votes to distribute. Take a moment to add items and vote on what you'd like to discuss."

*(Wait for votes)*

## 6. Discussion

- Facilitate the top-voted item(s)
- Use guardrails if needed:
  - "Can you give a specific example?"
  - "What did that look like in practice?"
  - "What signal did you miss in hindsight?"

**Potential carryover topics from last week:**
- "What are we reading lately?" (3 votes, not discussed)
- "Guidance for balancing writing a talk and work needs: Can I kill two birds with one stone if I write a more complex app for the talk?" (3 votes, not discussed)
- Claudio's AI Development Series — March scheduling and logistics update
- Joanna's event sourcing talk prep (using last week's feedback to shape content)
- Daniel's prompt/workflow library — any iteration since last week?
- TLC topic proposal process — did anyone post ideas to the channel?

**Suggested board items (if participation is low):**
- "Something I started but haven't shipped yet"
- "A workflow I changed this week because of AI"
- "Feedback I got that surprised me"
- "A side project I'm not sure is worth continuing"
- "Something I learned by explaining it to someone else"
- "A habit I'm trying to build (or break)"
- "A tool or technique I want to try but haven't yet"
- "Something I'm overthinking"
