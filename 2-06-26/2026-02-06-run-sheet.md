## 2. Welcome & Preamble

> "Welcome to Build in Public, or BiP.
>
> This is an open space for building—blog posts, workflows, hobby projects, or anything still forming. The point isn't polish, it's progress.
>
> We're here to share, encourage one another, and offer accountability. We all lift together. Come when you can, be an Improver, and build with us.
>
> Remember the law of two feet—bounce when you need to.
>
> Everyone comes to BiP with a goal. That goal might be curiosity, but everyone has one. Let's start by sharing our goals for this session."

## 4. Recap Last Week (1-30-26)

> "Quick recap from last week.
>
> We discussed **making better use of in-office time**—Alexander Reeves raised the question and we went around the room. The consensus: **intentionality**. The office isn't for heads-down work; it's for the serendipitous learning and relationship-building that happens when you're interruptible. Daniel put it well: if you came expecting to get heads-down work done, you made the wrong choice.
>
> Terrence brought up **teaching AI to non-technical people**—the challenge of bridging the vocabulary gap between developers and PMs. Claudio suggested voice journaling ideas first, then using AI to tailor them to different audiences. Daniel offered a three-question framework: What do you want them to do? What do they need to know? What feeling connects the two?
>
> We closed with Daniel's philosophical question about **aligning projects with your values**. Key frameworks emerged: *Have / Do / Be* (do you want to have a book, be an author, or just do the writing?) and *Achievement vs. Accolade* (intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation).
>
> That's where we left off."

**Suggested board items (if participation is low):**
- "Something I started but haven't shipped yet"
- "A workflow I changed this week because of AI"
- "Feedback I got that surprised me"
- "A side project I'm not sure is worth continuing"
- "Something I learned by explaining it to someone else"
