Here's a transcript of our Build in Public meeting.

Daniel Scheufler

It's thinking it's going. All right, we're now on the recording. OK, so topic that neat observation. We had this daily journaling back with air. It worked out pretty well, but journaling once a day and answering all six of the questions was exhausting.
Daniel Scheufler 0 minutes 20 seconds
So I pivoted from answering all six questions in the interactive mode to having it do the journal prompt on a transcript, because I can transcript way easier. And so I do this every couple of hours because that's about as far back as I can remember with sufficient detail and I produce.
Daniel Scheufler 0 minutes 36 seconds
Four, three or four of these notes every day. But what I realized is that by doing it, and especially the the reflect, relate, create portion on those, even if it was just reflecting back to me, made me start thinking about, well, why am I waiting on doing this? I remember very clearly one of my realizations like I'm on a team.
Daniel Scheufler 0 minutes 56 seconds
On my own, nobody is pushing back on my terrible design ideas. How do I fix that? Well, I realized I could make a fairly antagonistic, or at least respectfully push backing prompt to ask those questions back to me. I just need to update my workflow and write the prompt.
Daniel Scheufler 1 minute 16 seconds
And normally it would have taken me until the end of the week to realize, oh, I should do that. As a result of this journaling prompt, I realized the need, started thinking about what it would look like, and talked to myself about it the next day, and then finally realized I was about to start another story. So before I did that.
Daniel Scheufler 1 minute 33 seconds
Go do this thing and make use of it.
Daniel Scheufler 1 minute 37 seconds
Pretty nice little clear connection to personal growth, but the thing that kind of tied the bow on all this was some reading in a book I did over the break. There is a pedagogical method called narration.
Daniel Scheufler 1 minute 53 seconds
Which is very useful for synthesis. That is the the connection of your understanding to a bunch of the other stuff you know, and is extremely useful for students to produce because in the act of narrating what they have just learned, they are actively.
Daniel Scheufler 2 minutes 8 seconds
Accessing that memory, re-embedding it, and connecting it to their own knowledge, plus making a statement about that knowledge in a way that other students can understand, potentially better than the way the teacher was lecturing.
Daniel Scheufler 2 minutes 20 seconds
And it allows the teacher the chance to like, kind of go back as well. Hold on, what about this side right here? How do these two relate to to shore up the knowledge to make certain you don't miss bits? The act of transcribing meant I had to talk about what I was doing to an audience of one.
@1 52 minutes 16 seconds
Because you see, the products show up and then you look at the code.
@1 52 minutes 18 seconds
It's like holy cow, there are price matrix and price and discounts and vouchers and this and that.
@1 52 minutes 24 seconds
And eventually there's a number that shows up and somebody says that number does not look right.
@1 52 minutes 28 seconds
How did you get to it?
@1 52 minutes 30 seconds
You have some logging specific on the prices like. This is the full algorithm to get there all the branches.
@1 52 minutes 38 seconds
The values as it was going through.
@1 52 minutes 40 seconds
Not just will that help developers figure out and troubleshoot things, but business stakeholders, they will love you for.

That.

Speaker 1 (Houston - Conference Room Trust)
52 minutes 49 seconds52:49
@1 52 minutes 49 seconds
If if you turn that like the tool that you just show that you're using as a developer, think about turning that into something that the end user could go.
H
(Houston - Conference Room Trust)
52 minutes 57 seconds52:57
52 minutes 57 seconds
I see.
H
Speaker 1 (Houston - Conference Room Trust)
52 minutes 57 seconds52:57
@1 52 minutes 57 seconds
It's right there.
@1 52 minutes 58 seconds
The problem is right there.
H
Speaker 3 (Houston - Conference Room Trust)
52 minutes 59 seconds52:59
@3 52 minutes 59 seconds
Yeah. And we actually, we already have talked about that and I showed this to our our stakeholders at IFT and they said that they wanted something like this.
@3 53 minutes 7 seconds
So that way they can go through and when people do thumbs down or sponsor have given any feedback on a response.
@3 53 minutes 13 seconds
They can go through and see the step by step reasoning because right now it's.
H
(Houston - Conference Room Trust)
53 minutes 16 seconds53:16
53 minutes 16 seconds
Very.
H
Speaker 3 (Houston - Conference Room Trust)
53 minutes 16 seconds53:16
@3 53 minutes 16 seconds
Opaque to them.
H
(Houston - Conference Room Trust)
53 minutes 18 seconds53:18
53 minutes 18 seconds
There you go.
H
Speaker 3 (Houston - Conference Room Trust)
53 minutes 18 seconds53:18
@3 53 minutes 18 seconds
Know and I have to do it all and I'm not, you know, a food scientist.
@3 53 minutes 22 seconds
So it's like I can.
@3 53 minutes 23 seconds
I can read the responses and like you know, if it's easy things like, oh, there's just data that's missing.
@3 53 minutes 28 seconds
For whatever reason, which doesn't usually happen in production, usually it's just some logical miscalculation by the AI at one of the steps in whatever step they're trying to do to answer their questions.
H
(Houston - Conference Room Trust)
53 minutes 42 seconds53:42
53 minutes 42 seconds
Yeah.
H
Speaker 3 (Houston - Conference Room Trust)
53 minutes 43 seconds53:43
@3 53 minutes 43 seconds
So yeah, so give.
@3 53 minutes 44 seconds
So that was the other reason why I built it out in a UI as well is to be able to show the stakeholders so.
H
(Houston - Conference Room Trust)
53 minutes 53 seconds53:53
53 minutes 53 seconds
Awesome.

Daniel Scheufler 53 minutes 58 seconds
We are good. We are at time. Gentlemen, thank you all very much for your time for joining us and thank you for joining this build in public. As a result of today, we spent a lot of time discussing, well, a lot of our use of AI. Hopefully these techniques are useful to you in the future and we've got at least two interesting.

I'm (Matthew Wright) going to be one of the people taking the reigns of leading the initiative with Daniel leaving and I'd like to write a Teams message speaking to how we want to keep the spirit of Build in Public alive and I also want to propose new times on Friday that we can meet including a poll. I would also like to speak to some of the value I've gotten out of the initiative, for example, starting a blog, building confidence in public speaking, mentorship and direction.

Got it. This is a Teams channel post, not an email, so we’ll keep it conversational, human, and rally-the-troops-ish—not corporate announcement energy. Think: steady hand on the wheel, appreciation for what Daniel built, and an inviting “come shape this with me” tone.

Here’s a polished draft you can drop straight into Teams and tweak names/times as needed:

Hey everyone 👋

With Daniel stepping away, I’ll be helping take the reins on Build in Public, and I wanted to take a moment to do two things:

1. Say out loud that the spirit of this thing matters—and we want to keep it alive.
   What made Build in Public special wasn’t just demos or tooling, it was the permission to think out loud. To show unfinished work. To narrate decisions. To admit when something didn’t quite land and talk through why. That’s rare, and it’s valuable.

Personally, this initiative has had a bigger impact on me than I expected:

It pushed me to start a blog and share ideas instead of letting them sit half-formed in my head

It helped me build confidence speaking in front of people, especially without everything being perfectly rehearsed

It gave me mentorship and directional clarity—seeing how others reason through problems in real time has been incredibly grounding

I know I’m not the only one who’s gotten something meaningful out of it.

2. Propose a small reset on timing so we can keep momentum.
   To make this sustainable and accessible, I’d love to adjust our Friday time slot. Rather than guessing, I’ll post a poll with a few Friday options so we can find what works best for the group.

The goal isn’t to formalize this into something stiff—it’s to keep it lightweight, welcoming, and useful. Demos, ideas, experiments, half-baked thoughts, lessons learned the hard way… all still very much welcome.

If you’ve been on the fence about sharing: this is your sign.
If you’ve been quietly getting value from listening: that matters too.

More soon—poll coming right after this message.
Thanks everyone, and happy Friday.

— Matt

If you want, I can:

Make a shorter / punchier version

Add a stronger call for first-time presenters

Or tailor it to feel more grassroots vs program-leader depending on the audience vibe

Just tell me the energy you want to dial up.

this is perfect, help me work through some time options, we currently meet at 2:30-3:30

I'm thinking that bumping the meeting 30 minutes earlier as one option and another option as a Friday lunch meeting. We can also create space for people to suggest alternative times and speak to why 30 minutes earlier would help with me being there in person as I have to commute to pick up my daughter so the 2:00-3:00 slot would be most preferable for me.

Excellent instincts. You’re thinking about this exactly the right way: optimize for continuity + transparency, not “my schedule vs everyone else’s.” Also: any meeting that respects school pickup logistics is already morally superior. That’s just science.

Let’s work through this in two parts:

Time options that make sense

How to frame why one option helps you without making it about you

1. Time Options That Actually Work (and don’t feel arbitrary)

Right now: Friday 2:30–3:30

You want clear, minimal change options so people can quickly decide.

Option A — “Same meeting, just nudged”

Friday 2:00–3:00

Why this is strong:

It’s the least disruptive change (same duration, same day)

Keeps afternoon energy without running into end-of-day drop-off chaos

Allows you to be there in person, which quietly matters for leadership and continuity

This should absolutely be framed as the preferred option—not the only one.

Option B — “Brown bag Build in Public”

Friday 12:00–1:00 (Lunch session)

Why this works:

Lunch meetings feel optional and low-pressure

People can listen while eating, camera optional

It creates a different energy: more conversational, less calendar-fatigue

You might even position this as:

“Eat lunch, show cool stuff, think out loud.”

That sells itself.

Option C — “Something else we haven’t thought of yet”

Open suggestion option

This is important politically and culturally:

Signals you’re not locking this down unilaterally

Invites people who want to participate but can’t make Fridays work

Gives quieter folks a way to contribute without speaking up in the meeting

2. How to Explain the 30-Minute Shift (Without Over-explaining)

You want to:

Be honest

Be human

Avoid sounding like you’re optimizing for yourself at others’ expense

Here’s the framing that does that cleanly:

“The 2:00–3:00 slot is especially helpful for me because it allows me to attend in person before I need to commute to pick up my daughter.”

That’s it.
No apology. No guilt. No TED Talk on parenting logistics.

You’re not saying “do this for me”—you’re saying “this lets me show up fully.” That’s leadership, not inconvenience.

Suggested Poll Options (Copy/Paste Friendly)

When you post the poll, I’d recommend something like this:

Build in Public – Friday Time Options
Which time works best for you?

🕑 Friday 2:00–3:00 (30 minutes earlier than current)

🍴 Friday 12:00–1:00 (Lunch session)

🔄 Another time on Friday (I’ll comment with a suggestion)

❌ Fridays don’t work for me (I’ll comment with availability)

This gives you:

A clear winner

Insight into why something doesn’t work

Data to make a decision without guesswork

Optional Line to Add to Your Message (If You Want)

If you want to gently reinforce why the shift matters without making it the headline, you could add one sentence before the poll:

“For transparency, the 2:00–3:00 option also makes it easier for me to be there in person before I head out for school pickup.”

Short. Human. No violins.

If you want, next we can:

Tune the wording so it matches your exact Teams voice

Decide whether lunch should be every week or occasional

Or design a “rotating format” (demo week, discussion week, experiment week) now that you’re stepping into leadership

You’re doing this thoughtfully, and it shows.

5 people (the majority) selected 2-3.

let's make a serious seeming video of a robot walking out into a crowd of people and then holding up a sign that says 2-3pm wins.

Robot celebrates victory in office atrium
Share
let's draft a prompt for a video generating service of a robot walking into a room of software developers who are at their monitors working but also waiting in anticipation as if they're expecting an answer. The robot looks at a few of them, makes eye contact and then holds up a sign that says "2-3pm wins" and they erupt in applause. it should be very cinematic and dramatic

Oh this is delightfully unnecessary in exactly the right way. Let’s make this feel like a Denis Villeneuve film accidentally wandered into a Teams channel.

Below is a clean, copy-pasteable prompt you can drop into a video generation tool (Sora, Runway, Pika, etc.), followed by a couple of optional variants depending on how dramatic you want to go.

🎬 Cinematic Video Prompt

Style / Tone:
Cinematic, dramatic, serious, slightly humorous through contrast, high production value

Prompt:

A cinematic, dramatic scene inside a modern open-plan office filled with software developers. The room is quiet, tense, and softly lit by the glow of computer monitors. Developers sit at their desks, hands paused on keyboards, eyes subtly lifted as if waiting for an important verdict.

From the far end of the room, a humanoid robot enters slowly. Its footsteps echo softly on the floor. The robot walks with calm confidence, scanning the room. It pauses briefly to make deliberate eye contact with a few developers—one looks hopeful, another anxious, another nods knowingly.

The camera alternates between close-ups of focused faces and wide shots of the robot moving through the crowd. The music swells—low, cinematic, restrained tension.

The robot stops at the center of the room. In a smooth, deliberate motion, it raises a simple white sign.

The sign reads clearly in bold lettering: “2–3pm wins.”

For a beat, the room is silent.

Then the developers erupt into applause. People stand. Some laugh. Others clap with exaggerated seriousness. A few exchange victorious glances. The mood shifts instantly from tension to celebration.

The robot remains still, holding the sign as applause fills the room. Fade out on the glowing monitors, clapping hands, and the sign held high.

Ultra-realistic, cinematic lighting, shallow depth of field, dramatic camera movement, film-quality color grading.

🎥 Optional Enhancements (Pick One or Two)
🔊 Audio Direction (if supported)

Subtle ambient office hum, slow cinematic score building tension, applause crescendo at reveal.

🎞 Camera Language Upgrade

Slow dolly shot following the robot, shallow focus close-ups, slow push-in on the sign reveal.

😐 Humor via Seriousness (Highly Recommended)

The robot’s expression remains completely neutral and serious throughout, heightening the comedic contrast.

🧠 “Build in Public” Easter Egg (Optional)

A monitor briefly shows code or a terminal window in the background, reinforcing the developer setting.

🧪 Shorter “If the Tool Prefers Brevity” Version

Cinematic scene in a modern office full of software developers quietly working at glowing monitors, tension in the air. A humanoid robot walks into the room, makes brief eye contact with several developers, then stops and raises a sign reading “2–3pm wins.” After a pause, the developers erupt into applause. Dramatic lighting, cinematic camera movement, ultra-realistic, serious tone with subtle humor.

If you want, next we can:

Dial this even more dramatic (courtroom verdict energy)

Make it dry and absurdist

Or add a post-credit moment where the robot slowly lowers the sign and exits

This is exactly the kind of thing that makes people actually care about meeting outcomes.

here's the transcript of last week's build in public and a screenshot of the board we use to manage discussing items.

Perfect—this gives me enough signal to do something useful instead of just nodding thoughtfully. Here’s how I’d move us forward, and then I’ll give you a concrete artifact you can actually use.

What I’m Seeing (Quick Synthesis)
From the transcript

There’s a clear throughline across the session that’s worth naming explicitly going forward:

Narration > Explanation
Whether it’s journaling, debugging pricing logic, or explaining AI output to stakeholders, the winning move is making thinking visible.

Internal tools → External leverage
The moment someone said “what if end users could see this?”, the room lit up. That’s a Build in Public muscle you want to keep flexing.

AI as a reflective partner, not a magic answer box
The journaling pivot, antagonistic prompts, and reasoning UIs all point to the same idea: AI is most powerful when it pushes back.

That’s a strong identity for the group, even if it hasn’t been formally stated yet.

From the board screenshot

You already have a healthy pattern emerging:

Topics are experiential, not theoretical
(“How an AI therapist kicked my butt” > “AI in mental health”)

There’s a balance of:

Personal growth

Technical craft

Social / organizational dynamics

The board works best when:

1 item is actively discussed

Several are harvested and archived, not endlessly recycled

Right now the board is doing its job—but it could do an even better one with just a bit of framing.

What I’d Recommend You Do Next (Concrete, Low-Effort)

1. Add a one-sentence standing context to the board

At the top where it says “Set the context of the retrospective here…”, drop something like:

Build in Public is a space to narrate real work, unfinished thinking, and honest experiments—especially where AI changes how we reason, communicate, or grow.

This does two things:

Sets expectations for newcomers

Gives you cover when things get a little vulnerable or half-baked

2. Lightly formalize the flow (without killing the vibe)

You don’t need a process doc—just a shared rhythm:

Suggested weekly flow (implicit, not announced):

5 min – Quick framing (what kind of thinking we’re practicing today)

30–40 min – One primary discussion item

5–10 min – “What did we learn / steal for our own work?”

That last step matters. It turns a cool convo into transferable value.

3. Seed the next board with narration-shaped prompts

Instead of abstract topics, encourage cards like:

“A time AI confidently told me the wrong thing”

“Where explaining my code to a non-dev changed the design”

“A workflow I didn’t realize was broken until I talked it out”

You can model this once or twice and people will follow.

Optional (but powerful): A 2–3 sentence recap post

If you want, I can help you draft a short weekly recap template you can post after each session. Something like:

What was discussed

The insight that stuck

One question to carry into next week

That’s how you turn Build in Public into institutional memory, not just a good meeting.

Before I go further, one crisp question for you:

Do you want Build in Public to evolve more toward:

A facilitation-led practice (you actively guide the shape of thinking), or

A lightly moderated open forum (you mostly hold space and synthesize)?

Both are valid—but they lead to slightly different next steps.

I prefer: A lightly moderated open forum (you mostly hold space and synthesize)?

Because we're having another meeting today we should have a recap of the last meeting. please be sure to read through the transcript I shared with you thoroughly.

---

additional context of the shape of previous meetings:

Intro

- Should review, Intent of BiP, Rules of Engagement, Allow Everyone to Declare goal for Session

Welcome to Build in Public, or BiP. BiP is meant to create a collaborative, open space for , you guessed it, Building! That might be a blog post, or It might be a hobby project, the point is to build.
We're all gathered here to share, and build ideas, encourage one another, and offer some accountability. We all lift together! So Come when you can, be an Improver, and build with us! Remember the law of 2 feet, and bounce when you need.
Everyone comes to BiP with a goal. That goal might be curiosity today, but everyone has one. Let's start with our goals for this session...

## Outro

- Should Remind of Intent, connect today's actions to it, Thank Participants, and invite then back!

Alright everyone, thanks for joining this Build in Public! We're glad you could join us as we met and built! Today our open-space built on ... (examples from the meeting)! We'll have another session next week, and we hope to hear more and to celebrate with you! Be sure to bring your goals and your projects back next time! Until then, safe travels!

Perfect choice. A lightly moderated open forum with strong synthesis fits both the energy of this group and what actually happened in the last meeting. Daniel modeled that well, whether he meant to or not.

I’ve read through the transcript carefully (early journaling discussion and the later stakeholder / reasoning-UI conversation), and here’s a recap you can use today—both as a written recap and something you can read aloud or paraphrase during the intro.

I’ll give you:

A clean recap of last week’s session

A spoken-friendly version you can use live

A short connective outro tie-in, aligned with BiP’s intent

1. Build in Public – Recap of Last Session (Written)

Last week’s Build in Public focused on making thinking visible—both for ourselves and for others.

We started with a reflection on journaling and personal workflows. One key insight was that high-friction “perfect” processes don’t scale, even when they’re valuable. Moving from structured daily journaling questions to transcript-based reflection made it easier to capture thoughts more frequently and honestly. That shift surfaced something important: narration itself accelerates insight.

By reflecting out loud—first to ourselves, then to an imagined audience—we notice gaps, assumptions, and opportunities much faster than we would in isolation. That led to a realization many of us resonated with: working alone can hide bad ideas, and we often need respectful pushback to sharpen our thinking. AI, used intentionally, can act as that first layer of challenge.

Later in the session, this idea expanded from personal growth into product and stakeholder communication. We talked about how complex systems—like pricing logic or AI-driven outputs—often feel opaque once they reach users. When something looks “wrong,” the real question becomes: how did we get here?

The group discussed the power of exposing step-by-step reasoning—not just for developers debugging issues, but for non-technical stakeholders who need trust and clarity. Turning internal developer tools and reasoning logs into user-facing explanations was a recurring theme, and stakeholders have already shown strong interest in that kind of transparency.

Across both conversations, the throughline was clear:

Narration improves understanding

Transparency builds trust

Making reasoning visible benefits individuals, teams, and end users

This session was a strong example of Build in Public working as intended: unfinished thinking, real problems, and shared learning in the open.

2. Spoken Version (Natural, Not “Reading a Doc”)

You can open today’s meeting with something like this:

“Before we jump in, I want to quickly recap where we left off last time.

We spent a lot of time talking about narration—what happens when we explain our thinking out loud, whether that’s through journaling, AI reflection, or walking someone through a system. One big takeaway was that the act of narrating speeds up learning and exposes blind spots we don’t see when we work alone.

That showed up both personally and technically. On the personal side, simplifying journaling made it sustainable and more honest. On the technical side, we talked about how making reasoning visible—especially in AI systems—can help developers, stakeholders, and users understand why something happened, not just what the output was.

The common thread was transparency: using narration to build clarity, trust, and better outcomes.”

That’s it. Calm, grounded, no hype.

3. Tie-In to Today’s Intent (Light Touch, Open Forum Friendly)

To connect this back to the BiP intent without steering the room too hard:

“That idea—making thinking visible—is very much in the spirit of Build in Public. So as we go into today’s session, whether you’re sharing a project, a workflow, or just a question, remember that half-formed thinking is welcome here. The value is often in the explanation, not the polish.”

4. Optional Outro (Aligned With Your Existing Script)

When you close today, you can subtly reinforce continuity:

“Thanks everyone for building with us today. Just like last week, today showed how much value there is in talking through our work—whether it’s a tool, an idea, or a process that’s still evolving. Build in Public is about showing the work, not just the results, and we appreciate everyone who shared and listened. Bring your goals and your projects back next time—we’ll keep building together.”

If you want, next we can:

Create a 1-paragraph recurring recap template you reuse every week

Draft a standing ‘Rules of Engagement’ slide/text that matches this open-forum vibe

Help you phrase a gentle nudge that invites quieter participants without pressure

You’re doing the right thing here: holding space, naming patterns, and letting the group do the rest.

Document
transcription

Got it 👍 — based on context, here’s a cleaned, human-readable transcription summary of last week’s Build in Public session, distilled from the raw transcript you shared. This is suitable to read aloud, post in Teams, or keep as the official recap for continuity going into today’s meeting.

Build in Public — Session Transcription (Cleaned & Synthesized)

Last week’s Build in Public centered on a difficult but important theme: creating space for honest, sometimes uncomfortable conversations about AI—especially in environments where AI adoption is assumed or mandated.

1. AI Resistance Is Often Emotional, Not Technical

The group discussed how resistance to AI rarely shows up today as “the tools aren’t capable,” but instead as deeper concerns:

Fear of job loss or reduced value as a knowledge worker

Anxiety about keeping up, especially for more seasoned professionals

Worries about environmental impact, ethics, and long-term societal outcomes

Several participants noted that these fears are often dismissed—sometimes unintentionally—through body language, tone, or over-rational responses, which can shut people down rather than invite dialogue.

The takeaway: people are talking—but we may not be listening in the way they need.

2. Public vs. Private Conversations Require Different Tones

A key tension emerged around where these conversations should happen.

Public forums can quickly polarize into extremes (“doom” vs. “don’t worry about it”)

One-on-one conversations create psychological safety and trust

Both are necessary—but they serve different purposes

The group generally agreed:

Fear should first be met privately, with empathy and listening

Public conversations should focus on understanding patterns, not adjudicating fears

3. Engineers Aren’t Always Equipped for “Human” Conversations

There was honest reflection that many engineers:

Aren’t naturally strong in emotional or relational conversations

May lack tools or language to engage effectively with fear

Default to problem-solving when listening is what’s needed

This creates a gap—especially for non-technical improvers, who may want to benefit from AI but don’t know where to start or feel intimidated asking.

4. Supporting Non-Technical Roles Requires a Different Approach

A concrete example was shared of helping a non-developer learn AI from a business and ROI perspective, rather than explaining how LLMs work.

This approach focused on:

Stakeholder needs

Metrics, outcomes, and reporting

Convenience and usefulness, not internals

The result: a productive, confidence-building conversation—because the starting point matched the person’s reality.

Many people don’t care how the sausage is made. They care whether dinner helps them do their job.

5. Making Space for Quieter Voices

The group acknowledged that a few recurring voices dominate most discussions, while others may have valuable perspectives but remain silent.

A practical suggestion emerged:

Pay attention to who isn’t speaking

Gently invite quieter voices without pressure

Interrupt dominance (including our own) to rebalance the room

This was framed not as correction, but as collective responsibility.

6. Structured Practices Can Help (Without Forcing Vulnerability)

A facilitation technique from Liberating Structures—Troika Consulting—was proposed as a way to:

Give people a safe format to share challenges

Let others reason about the problem without dogpiling

Allow the “client” to listen, reflect, and choose next steps

This was seen as a promising way to surface concerns—especially from non-developers—without putting them on the spot.

7. What Is and Is Not Build in Public

The group clarified an important boundary:

Build in Public is about thought leadership, learning, and making work visible

Some topics (like deep fear or people-management issues) may need to move to other spaces

That said, BiP can still:

Surface signals

Name patterns

Encourage empathy and better listening

8. Additional Topics Touched

Later in the session, the group also explored:

Using AI to analyze private documents safely (local models, privacy controls, anonymization)

Nested Function League as a collaborative kata for brainstorming and skill-building

The value of pairing with people you don’t normally work with, especially in an in-office environment

Closing Reflection

This session reinforced that Build in Public works best when it’s a space for narration, listening, and unfinished thinking—not just demos or answers. The value came not from resolving every issue, but from naming tensions honestly and modeling how to hold them without shutting people down.

If you want next, I can:

Turn this into a 1-page Teams post

Create a spoken 60-second recap for today’s intro

Extract 2–3 “carry-forward” questions to seed today’s discussion board

Just say the word.

let's create a short recap that includes the welcome to BIP preamble and also include some suggestions for the board (that aren't meant to be read aloud)

Love this. You’re basically asking for a “host card”: something that sets the tone out loud and quietly shapes behavior without over-facilitating. Very on-brand for a lightly moderated open forum.

Below is a short recap that:

Starts with the Welcome to BiP preamble (spoken)

Includes a concise recap of last week (spoken)

Ends with board suggestions clearly marked as not to be read aloud

You can paste this into Teams or keep it as your host notes.

Build in Public — Welcome & Recap
Welcome to Build in Public

Welcome to Build in Public, or BiP.

BiP is meant to create a collaborative, open space for—you guessed it—building. That might be a blog post, a workflow, a hobby project, or an idea that’s still forming. The point isn’t polish; the point is progress.

We’re here to share, encourage one another, and offer accountability. We all lift together. Come when you can, be an Improver, and build with us. Remember the law of two feet—if you need to step away, bounce when you need.

Everyone comes to BiP with a goal. That goal might just be curiosity today, but everyone has one.
Let’s start by sharing our goals for this session.

Quick Recap from Last Session

Last week’s BiP focused on making thinking visible—especially around AI.

We talked about how resistance to AI often isn’t about capability, but about fear: fear of job loss, fear of falling behind, fear of misalignment between personal values and workplace expectations. A key insight was that these concerns are real, but they’re often unintentionally dismissed in public spaces.

We explored the difference between public and private conversations, and how each requires a different tone. Trust and listening matter, especially for non-technical roles who want to benefit from AI but don’t know where to start.

A recurring theme was listening before solving—understanding someone’s context, goals, and constraints before offering technical answers. We also talked about the importance of making space for quieter voices and being mindful of who is—and isn’t—speaking.

Overall, the session was a strong example of Build in Public doing what it’s meant to do: surfacing real tensions, unfinished thinking, and shared learning without needing to fully resolve everything in the room.

(Not Read Aloud) — Suggestions for the Board

When adding discussion items, consider framing them around experience and narration, for example:

“A moment where AI challenged my assumptions”

“Something I had to explain out loud before I understood it”

“A workflow that worked technically but failed socially”

“Helping a non-technical stakeholder use AI effectively”

“A time I realized I was solving the wrong problem”

Half-formed ideas, open questions, and works in progress are welcome. The value is often in the explanation, not the outcome.

If you want, next we can:

Create a one-paragraph standing BiP description you reuse every week

Draft a recurring host checklist (intro → recap → flow → outro)

Or design a gentle board hygiene rule (when items graduate to “Done Discussing”)

You’re doing exactly what this space needs: holding it steady while letting it breathe.

I'd like to share another screencap of an older board to give you a better sense of the direction we want to go in for board items

This screenshot is very helpful. It clarifies the directional difference you’re aiming for, and honestly—it explains why BiP has worked when it works.

Let me reflect back what this older board is doing right, then I’ll give you concrete guidance + examples you can use going forward to shape new board items without over-policing them.

What This Older Board Reveals (Why It Works)

This board has a very distinct signature:

1. Items are situational, not generic

Compare:

❌ “AI in DevOps”

✅ “Potential talk: Using AI in DevOps / Platform Engineering”

or

❌ “Journaling”

✅ “Neat Observation / Realization related to the Daily Journaling Practice, Pedagogy, and Personal Growth”

These aren’t topics.
They’re moments of lived experience.

That’s huge.

2. Many cards imply a story already happened

Several items clearly come after someone tried something:

“how to build logging systems for AI development”

“Building AI talk”

“Creating TLC, Improving Talk, and Come Together talks…”

These feel like:

“I did a thing. I learned something. I’m not done yet.”

That’s exactly the Build in Public sweet spot.

3. The board implicitly supports thought leadership

Not “thought leadership” as in polished talks, but as in:

sense-making

articulation

translation for others

Which aligns perfectly with what Daniel articulated near the end of the transcript:

BiP is an on-ramp to thought leadership, not a debate forum.

This board reflects that without ever saying it out loud.

The Direction You’re Heading (And Should Lean Into)

Based on:

the transcript

your recap goals

this older board

I’d describe the ideal BiP board item as:

A snapshot of thinking-in-motion that could help someone else reason better.

Not a question.
Not a demo.
Not a rant.

A work-in-progress articulation.

Practical Board Guidance (You Can Keep This Private)

You don’t need rules—just gentle gravitational pull.

Encourage board items that:

Start with something that happened

Imply unfinished thinking

Are grounded in real work, not hypotheticals

Light reframing you can model (by example, not enforcement):
Instead of… Nudge toward…
“AI privacy” “Exploring AI privacy tradeoffs for personal docs”
“AI adoption” “Helping a non-technical teammate adopt AI”
“Public speaking” “Building confidence by giving unfinished talks”

If you post a few items like this, others will follow suit naturally.

Suggested “Invisible” Board Prompts (Not Read Aloud)

You could keep this as a mental checklist, or occasionally paste it under the board header:

“Something I tried that didn’t work the way I expected”

“A realization I only had after explaining it to someone else”

“A tool that worked technically but failed socially”

“A problem that got clearer once I narrated it”

“A talk, blog, or idea I’m shaping—not finished”

These mirror the older board’s energy almost exactly.

One Subtle but Important Insight

The older board does not optimize for:

speed

resolution

votes-as-truth

It optimizes for revisitable thinking.

That’s why items can live in Done Discussing without being “done” in real life. They’ve simply been harvested.

That’s a really healthy pattern—and you should keep it.

If You Want One Tiny Upgrade (Optional)

You might consider renaming “Done Discussing” internally (not necessarily in the UI) as:

“Harvested”

“Captured Learnings”

“Discussed (for now)”

You don’t have to change anything—but it can help you frame when to move cards without feeling like you’re closing a loop prematurely.

If you want, next we can:

Draft 3–5 seed cards you can drop into the next board

Create a one-sentence board context that subtly steers behavior

Design a lightweight cadence for when cards move columns

You’re already steering this in the right direction—now it’s just about keeping the signal strong without tightening the grip.

My topic will be something like "how do you validate your ideas to know that they're ready to be shared publicly"

That’s a great topic—and it fits the BiP ethos almost perfectly. The only tweak I’d suggest is to shape it so it reads less like a general advice question and more like a moment of lived uncertainty.

Right now it’s good. With a tiny nudge, it becomes magnetic.

Below are a few refinements, plus guidance on how to frame it live without turning it into a panel or a self-help seminar.

Strong Board-Ready Versions (Pick One)
Option 1 — Personal + Reflective (My top recommendation)

How I decide when an idea is “ready” to share publicly (and when it isn’t)

Why this works:

Signals experience, not abstraction

Invites others to share their heuristics

Avoids the “please teach me” posture

Option 2 — Vulnerability-Forward

Knowing when to share an idea publicly vs. letting it incubate longer

This subtly acknowledges fear and restraint without naming it explicitly.

Option 3 — BiP-Explicit

Validating ideas before sharing them publicly in Build in Public

This anchors the discussion inside the group’s shared context.

Option 4 — Narration-Centered

What convinces me an idea is real enough to share

Short. Slightly poetic. Surprisingly effective.

How to Open the Discussion (What You Say Live)

You don’t want to teach. You want to model uncertainty.

Here’s a natural opener you can use almost verbatim:

“This is something I’m actively wrestling with. I have a lot of ideas—blog posts, talks, half-formed thoughts—and I often don’t know when something is actually ready to be shared publicly versus when I’m just excited about it.

I’m less interested in a checklist and more curious how other people here decide. What signals do you look for before you hit ‘publish’ or raise your hand?”

That framing:

Keeps you on equal footing

Prevents advice-dumping

Invites stories instead of prescriptions

Invisible Guardrails (So It Doesn’t Drift)

If the conversation starts to slide into generic advice, you can gently steer it back with questions like:

“Can you think of a time you shared something too early—or waited too long?”

“What was the signal you missed in hindsight?”

“Who were you really sharing it for?”

These bring it back to experience, which is where BiP shines.

Why This Topic Is a Sneaky Power Move

This discussion naturally surfaces:

Confidence vs. perfectionism

Audience awareness

Psychological safety

Iterative publishing

Fear disguised as “not ready yet”

…without you ever naming those things explicitly.

It’s also highly transferable—everyone in the room can use the answers immediately.

Final Recommendation

If I had to lock one in, I’d go with:

How I decide when an idea is “ready” to share publicly

It’s personal, open-ended, and perfectly aligned with the culture you’re building.

If you want next, I can help you:

Pre-seed 2–3 follow-up questions

Write a 30-second closing synthesis once the discussion wraps

Turn insights from the discussion into a future board item or blog post

This one’s going to land well.

I plan to move this conversation to my IDE so I would like you to create a document with as much context as possible so the transition is seamless.
Build In Public – Context & Facilitation Notes
Build in Public (BiP)
Purpose of This Document

This document exists to preserve full conversational context for Build in Public as it transitions into an IDE-based workflow. It is intended to:

Capture the spirit, intent, and operating principles of BiP

Summarize recent discussions and learnings

Provide guidance for shaping board items and facilitation

Anchor an upcoming discussion topic on validating ideas before sharing publicly

This is not a formal process doc. It is a working memory artifact.

What Build in Public Is

Build in Public (BiP) is a lightly moderated open forum designed to create space for:

Narrating real work

Sharing unfinished thinking

Exploring ideas in motion

Learning through explanation, not performance

BiP is intentionally not about polished demos, debates, or arriving at consensus. Its value comes from making thinking visible and allowing others to reason alongside it.

Core Characteristics

Open, collaborative, and voluntary

Grounded in lived experience ("I tried…", "I noticed…", "I realized…")

Low-pressure, high-trust

Focused on learning and articulation rather than resolution

BiP functions as an on-ramp to thought leadership, not a gate.

Standard Session Shape (Loose, Not Prescriptive)
Intro

Welcome to Build in Public

Restate intent and rules of engagement

Remind participants of the law of two feet

Invite everyone to declare a goal for the session (curiosity counts)

Middle

One primary discussion item (sometimes two)

Open discussion, lightly moderated

Emphasis on narration, not expertise

Outro

Reconnect discussion to BiP intent

Acknowledge contributors

Invite participants back

Encourage bringing goals and works-in-progress to the next session

Key Learnings from Recent Sessions (Synthesis)

1. Narration Accelerates Insight

Explaining work out loud—whether through journaling, AI reflection, or peer discussion—reveals gaps, assumptions, and opportunities faster than working alone.

Narration benefits:

Personal clarity

Better system design

Improved stakeholder communication

2. AI Resistance Is Often Emotional, Not Technical

Resistance to AI has shifted from questions of capability to concerns about:

Job security

Identity and personal values

Environmental and societal impact

These concerns are real and often unintentionally dismissed in public forums.

3. Public vs. Private Conversations Need Different Tones

Private conversations build trust and allow fear to be met with empathy

Public conversations help surface patterns and shared understanding

Both are necessary; neither alone is sufficient

4. Engineers Often Default to Solving Instead of Listening

Many engineers lack tools or comfort for emotional or relational conversations. This can unintentionally silence non-technical voices or those still forming their understanding.

5. Supporting Non-Technical Roles Requires Translation, Not Internals

Non-technical improvers benefit most from AI when discussions start with:

Business goals

ROI

Stakeholder needs

Explaining how "the sausage is made" is often less helpful than explaining how it helps someone do their job.

6. Quieter Voices Carry Untapped Value

A small number of recurring voices often dominate discussion. BiP works best when:

Facilitators notice who is not speaking

Space is gently made for quieter contributors

Dominance (including facilitator dominance) is interrupted when needed

7. Build in Public Has Boundaries

Not all topics belong in BiP. Some conversations—especially those centered on deep fear or people management—may need to move elsewhere.

BiP can still:

Surface signals

Name tensions

Encourage better listening

Board Philosophy

The BiP board is not a backlog or a voting mechanism for truth.

An effective board item is:

A snapshot of thinking-in-motion that could help someone else reason better.

Board Items Should:

Be experiential, not abstract

Imply a story already happened

Reflect unfinished thinking

Be grounded in real work

Examples of Strong Board Items

"Neat observation related to daily journaling and personal growth"

"How I built logging systems for AI development"

"Creating talks from unfinished thinking"

Items Are Moved to "Done Discussing" When:

The group has harvested insight

Not because the topic is resolved

Think of this column as Harvested, not finished.

Suggested Board Prompt Patterns (Not Read Aloud)

Something I tried that didn’t work the way I expected

A realization I only had after explaining it to someone else

A tool that worked technically but failed socially

A problem that got clearer once I narrated it

A talk, blog, or idea I’m shaping—not finished

These prompts subtly guide the board without enforcing rules.

Current Discussion Topic Context
Working Title

How I decide when an idea is “ready” to share publicly

Why This Topic Fits BiP

It is experiential, not prescriptive

It surfaces vulnerability without forcing it

It naturally invites stories rather than advice

It aligns with narration, confidence, and iteration

Framing Notes

This topic should be introduced as something actively being wrestled with—not as a request for best practices.

The goal is to explore:

Signals people look for before sharing

Times people shared too early or waited too long

How audience, context, and fear influence decisions

Avoid turning the discussion into:

A checklist

A publishing playbook

A debate about confidence vs. perfectionism

Facilitation Guardrails (Invisible)

If discussion drifts toward abstraction, gently steer with:

"Can you think of a time you shared something too early—or too late?"

"What signal did you miss in hindsight?"

"Who were you really sharing it for?"

These questions pull conversation back to lived experience.

Closing Thought

Build in Public works when it remains:

Human

Incomplete

Generous

This document is not meant to freeze the practice—only to carry its memory forward as tools and contexts change.

Done. I’ve created a single, comprehensive context document in the canvas titled “Build in Public – Context & Facilitation Notes.”

This is intentionally:

IDE-ready (no fluff, no meta commentary)

Memory-preserving (captures intent, philosophy, and recent synthesis)

Future-proof (reads like a living artifact, not meeting notes)

You should be able to drop this straight into your IDE, hand it to an agent, or use it as grounding context for:

drafting future recaps

seeding board items

writing blog posts or talks

onboarding a future co-facilitator without a live brain dump

If you want next, we can:

Add a “Derived Artifacts” section (e.g., blog outlines, talk seeds)

Extract a shortened agent prompt distilled from this doc

Create a weekly append-only section so BiP accrues institutional memory over time

You’re doing something rare here: you’re not just running a meeting—you’re curating a practice.

Build In Public 2026-20260123_141337-Meeting Recording.vtt
File
here's last week's transcript (1-23-26), I'm preparing for today's meeting (1-30-26)

Awesome context, thank you — this is exactly the kind of thing that benefits from being handed off cleanly to an IDE.

Below is a single, IDE-ready document you can drop straight into your repo (e.g. docs/bip/2026-01-30-meeting-context.md). It’s written to preserve continuity from last week (1-23-26) into today’s meeting (1-30-26), includes a short recap, a welcome preamble, and private board suggestions (clearly marked as not to be read aloud).

I’ve synthesized this primarily from the 1-23-26 transcript you shared, which itself builds on themes that have been recurring across BIP: thought leadership vs airing concerns, validation before publishing, and how to create psychological safety while still building publicly.

Build In Public — Meeting Context

Date: 2026-01-30
Prepared by: Matt
Reference: Prior meeting transcript (2026-01-23)

1. Purpose of This Document

This document exists to:

Smoothly transition context from the 1-23-26 BIP meeting into today’s discussion

Ground today’s topic in what was actually said last week (not vibes, not vibes-based memory 😄)

Provide facilitator-only guidance for steering the board conversation

Capture framing language that can be reused later for write-ups, posts, or talks

This is not a script — it’s scaffolding.

2. Quick Recap: Last Week (1-23-26)
   High-level themes that surfaced

1. Build In Public ≠ “Air Everything”
   There was a clear distinction made between:

Build In Public as an on-ramp to thought leadership

Other spaces (like AIR) that are more about reskilling, processing, or surfacing discomfort

The group explicitly acknowledged that:

Some conversations feel important but don’t yet belong in a public-facing BIP context

Not everything that matters is ready to be “built in public”

2. Psychological Safety vs. Public Framing
   A recurring tension:

People want to be honest about fear, resistance, or uncertainty (especially around AI)

But public spaces change tone, incentives, and risk

There was agreement that:

Private and public conversations serve different purposes

The same idea may need to mature privately before it’s shared publicly

3. Validation Before Visibility
   Implicit question that never quite got named (but was everywhere):

“How do I know when something is ready to share publicly without it blowing up, getting misunderstood, or harming people?”

That question is the through-line into today.

3. Welcome to BIP — Preamble (Read Aloud)

“Welcome to Build In Public.

This space exists to help us turn half-formed ideas into clear thought leadership — together.

You don’t need a finished product. You don’t need a hot take.
What you need is a willingness to explore an idea honestly, get feedback, and decide what’s worth carrying forward — and what isn’t.

Not every idea is ready for the public internet.
Build In Public is where we figure out which ones are.”

(Short. Grounding. Sets expectations without pressure.)

4. Today’s Topic (Your Framing)
   Working Title

“How do you validate your ideas before you share them publicly?”

Why this topic fits now

Last week showed clear friction between:

Ideas that feel important

And ideas that are ready to be public artifacts

People are already doing validation informally — journaling, 1:1s, private AI prompts, quiet experimentation

We just haven’t named it as a skill

Core question to pose

“What signals tell you that an idea is ready to leave your head — and enter the world?”

Optional follow-ups if the room needs traction:

What validation happens before you ever post, talk, or build?

Who do you test ideas with first — and why?

What’s the cost of sharing too early? What’s the cost of waiting too long?

5. Board Suggestions (NOT Read Aloud)

⚠️ These are facilitation notes only.
They are not meant to be spoken verbatim.

A. Keep the conversation concrete

If things drift abstract:

Ask for specific examples

“What did that look like in practice?”

“How did you know it was ready?”

Gently interrupt theory spirals (we love them, but still 😅)

B. Normalize “pre-public” validation

Reinforce that validation can include:

Private journaling (human or AI-assisted)

Sharing with one trusted peer

Talking it out verbally before writing

Trying the idea in a low-stakes space (internal talk, small group, prototype)

This reframes “not sharing yet” as intentional, not fearful.

C. Watch for safety signals

If someone starts sharing something raw:

Let it land

Then help the group distinguish:

“This is important”

vs.

“This is ready for a public artifact”

That distinction is the muscle BIP is here to build.

D. Optional close if time runs tight

A strong wrap question:

“What’s one idea you’re holding right now — and what would validate it enough for you to share it publicly?”

6. Why This Matters (Meta)

This topic quietly solves multiple problems:

Prevents premature posting that people later regret

Gives permission to not perform thought leadership

Creates a shared language for maturity, readiness, and care

Strengthens BIP as a craft space, not a content mill

Also… it scales.
This framing works just as well for:

Blog posts

Talks

Internal proposals

Open-source projects

Even code reviews (don’t @ me, but yes)

7. Notes for Future You

This conversation is a seed for:

A short post: “Not everything belongs in public — here’s how I decide”

A lightweight framework (signals > stages)

A follow-up session on audience-specific validation

If today feels calm, that’s a win.
It means the group is learning discernment — not just output.

If you want, next we can:

Turn this into a facilitation checklist

Extract a clean talk outline

Or write the post-meeting recap while it’s fresh

Just say the word.
